# django blog

My first foray into Django and web development. While originally intending to build my own portfolio and blogging site from ground up, I've decided to abandon the idea as Fastpages gives me what I need better (Jupyter support) as a data scientist. Still, it turned out to be a really cool project for my cat, Pippi!

Of course, since then I've learn way more about HTML and CSS (juggling the front and back-end of things is really rough when you're new to both) via the freecodecamp certification.

I liked that I learnt how to make fancy grid cards on the front page...
